# TCU Research Apprenticeship Program - Viral Model



## Running
**(works best in linux using anaconda 3.7)**

Download to any directory, which will be referenced as `base/`

CD to ```base/``` and run to run the entire test (takes a long time):
```bash
javac runTest.java; java runTest
```
to run an individual test, CD to ```base/``` and run
```bash
python 2DProbabilityViralTransmission.py
```
if you have multiple versions of python installed, use `python3 2DProba...`

## Requires

* [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I recommend just downloading [anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) (included in Anaconda)
* Java JDK 11.0.4 (untested on lower versions, but it should work)
